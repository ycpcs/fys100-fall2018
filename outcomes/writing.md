title: "Effective Writing"
---

You will be doing a significant amount of writing in this FYS course and in other courses throughout your college career.

This document describes some of the qualities of effective written communication and how you can achieve them.

**Use clear language.**  The goal of written communication is to convey your thoughts and ideas.  You won't do this effectively if it's hard for the reader to figure out what you're trying to say.  So, use language as clearly, directly, and precisely as you can.  Use correct grammar.  Make your phrases and sentences as simple as possible.  Use fancy words sparingly, and when you do use them, use them correctly.  Avoid passive voice.

**Organize your ideas.**  Every written work needs a structure.  Topics should flow smoothly and should build towards a conclusion.  You should make an outline before you start writing.  "Stream of consciousness" writing might be helpful when you are getting your ideas down, but in general will lead to poor organization.

**Think about your audience.**  Include details that the person reading will find interesting and informative.  Place less emphasis on details that you can expect the reader to be familiar with already.

**Proofread and revise.**  It is essential to carefully proofread and edit everything you write.  Proofread for spelling, grammar, and phrasing.  Read what you wrote out loud: does it make sense?  Could it be more clear?  Think about the overall structure of your composition.  Do the topics flow well?  Are supporting details provided for claims?  In general, don't be afraid to make substantial revisions to what you wrote.  Don't stop until it's as good as it can be.

**Use the Writing Center.**  The [Writing Center](http://www.ycp.edu/about-us/offices-and-departments/center-for-teaching-and-learning/writing-center/) is an excellent resource for getting help on your writing assignments.  Make an appointment to discuss your work with a tutor.
