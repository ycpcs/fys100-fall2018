Course Description
------------------

Computers today are a powerful medium for creative expression. We will explore the exciting world of creative computing in a series of hands-on projects for users at all levels. We will create art and music, analyze literature and scientific data, and use computers to control and interact with the physical environment. No programming experience is required; just bring your curiosity and a sense of digital adventure.

Prerequisites
-------------

None

Course Structure and Expectations
---------------------------------

This course is a hands-on exploration of the applications of computing in a variety of disciplines.  It is also an introduction to the skills and habits that will help you succeed in college, and make the most of your undergraduate experience.

The course is intended to be *fun*:

> "Anyone who tries to make a distinction between education and entertainment doesn't know the first thing about either."&nbsp; &mdash; Marshall McLuhan

The work in this course will be open-ended and exporatory, and there will not be any inherently right or wrong answers.  Our shared goal is to explore and think critically about what we've done.

Class meetings will consist primarily of hands-on activities and discussions: these will serve as a starting point for assignments.

Many of the projects and activities will involve using computer programs to do interesting things.  However, there is no expectation that you know how to write computer programs coming into the course, and you will learn everything you will need to know about programming as part of the course activities.  Ultimately, the programs we work on will serve as a medium for exploring art, music, text, and scientific data.

Policies
--------

### Grades

Grades are assigned on a 100-point scale:

> Numeric Range|Letter Grade
> -------------|------------
> 93&ndash;100|A (4.0)
> 88&ndash;93|B+ (3.5)
> 83&ndash;88|B (3.0)
> 78&ndash;83|C+ (2.5)
> 70&ndash;78|C (2.0)
> 60&ndash;70|D (1.0)
> 0&ndash;60|F (0.0)

Your overall grade for the course will be determined as follows:

* Assignments: 85%
* Attendance: 5%
* Participation: 10%

### Course website

Please check the course web page, <https://ycpcs.github.io/fys100-fall2018>, regularly for important announcements.

### Reading Assignments

The [Schedule](schedule.html) lists the reading assignments for each class meeting.  Please make sure to do the reading *before* you come to class, since the day's activity and/or discussion will depend on it.

### Homework assignments

The [Assignments](assign/index.html) page lists the assignments.

All of the assignments involve some combination of (1) critical reading of source texts, (2) critical thinking, (3) writing, and (4) the use of computer programs as a creative medium.

### Late Assignments

Assignments may be submitted up to two (2) days late, with a grade reduction of 10% per day late.

### Attendance and Participation

Class meetings will consist primarily of activities, discussions, and presentations, so it is extremely important that you attend every class meeting, and participate fully in each class meeting.

Repeated unexcused absences, or failure to participate in class activities, will reduce your participation grade.  I will consider 6 or more unexcused absences to be grounds for assigning a failing grade for the course.

If there are unavoidable circumstances that prevent you from attending a class meeting, please let me know as soon as you can so we can work out an accomodation.

### Academic Integrity

York College's mission statement stipulates that strict adherence to principles of academic honesty is expected of all students. Therefore, academic dishonesty will not be tolerated at York College. Academic dishonesty refers to actions such as, but not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabricating research, falsifying academic documents, etc., and includes all situations where students make use of the work of others and claim such work as their own.

When a faculty member believes a student has committed an act of academic dishonesty, the faculty member must promptly notify the student in writing and obtain confirmation of notification from the student.  The faculty member then has ten business days from that written notification to the student to report the incident to the Dean of Academic Affairs and the Department Chair. Documentation related to instances of academic dishonesty will be kept on file in the student's permanent record. The faculty member has full discretion to determine a suitable penalty for the student, up to a course grade of 0.  This discretion is limited to the course in which the dishonesty took place.  Students may not withdraw from a course in which they have been accused of academic dishonesty, unless and until the accusation is withdrawn by the faculty member or is overturned by the Student Welfare Committee or the Dean of Academic Affairs.

Students who believe they have been unjustly charged or sanctioned must discuss the situation with the faculty member and have 10 business days thereafter to submit an appeal to Student Welfare Committee through the Dean of Academic Affairs. If an appeal is filed, the Student Welfare Committee will then conduct a hearing to review the charge and/or sanction.  In the case of an egregious first offense, the faculty member may request that the Student Welfare Committee conduct a hearing and determine a sanction, which may involve academic probation, suspension or dismissal from the College.

If the Dean of Academic Affairs determines that the academic dishonesty is the student's second offense, the Dean will provide written notification to the student, the faculty member, and the Department Chair. The Student Welfare Committee will automatically conduct a hearing to review the charge and decide on an appropriate sanction, which will involve academic probation, suspension or dismissal from the College. Students who believe the Student Welfare Committee has unjustly sanctioned them may submit a written appeal to the Dean of Academic Affairs within 72 hours of receiving notification of the Student Welfare Committee's sanction.

### Use of Personal Technology in the Classroom

While York College recognizes students' need for educational and emergency-related technological devices such as laptops, PDA's, cellular phones, etc., using them unethically or recreationally during class time is never appropriate. The college recognizes and supports faculty members' authority to regulate in their classrooms student use of all electronic devices.

### Communication Standards

York College recognizes the importance of effective communication in all disciplines and careers. Therefore, students are expected to competently analyze, synthesize, organize, and articulate course material in papers, examinations and presentations. In addition, students should know and use communication skills current to their field of study, recognize the need for revision as part of their writing process, and employ standard conventions of English usage in both writing and speaking. Students may be asked to further revise assignments that do not demonstrate effective use of these communication skills.
