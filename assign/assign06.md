# Deliverables

There are several deliverables for this assignment. Create a folder called `Assignment 6` on your Google Drive and create a document called `Assignment 6 Report` that will contain the Technical Report and Reflection, and the Peer Evaluation.

## Milestone Demos

There are three Milestone demos:

* Monday, Nov 26th: show that you have started on the Processing code, hardware, and physical contruction of your installation
* Monday, Dec 3rd: show that the interactive features of your system are at least partially working
* Monday, Dec 10th: demonstrate your system working with a reasonable degree of completion (dry run for the final demo)

## Final Demo

On Monday, Dec 17th, from 3&ndash;5 PM, each group will do a final demo of their project.

## Technical Report and Reflection

Submit an <b>individual</b> technical report describing your installation's operation, your <u>individual</u> contribution to the project, and your reflections regarding the process. Write at least a one page report outlining:

* Part A: The vision for your project. What was inspiration for your installation? What were you trying to achieve? 
* Part B: How well do you believe you realized that vision? What challenges did you overcome? What elements of the installation are you most proud? 
* Part C: Reflect on what skill sets did you use from this course to create the installation. In planning for future courses, what elements could the instructors focus on? What elements could use less emphasis?

At the end of your report (does not count towards the page requirement) complete a peer evaluation of your team by answering the following questions:

* What grade (out of 100) do you believe you deserve for this project? (Provide a brief justification.)
* List your teammates for this project and describe their primary contributions to the project (if any).
* List your teammates for this project and indicate what grade (0-100) you believe they should receive?

The technical report and reflection is due Friday, Dec 14th.
