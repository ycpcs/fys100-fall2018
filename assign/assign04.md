title: "Assignment 4: Music composition"
---

Due dates:

* Draft of essay due **Wednesday, Oct 10th** by 11:59 PM
* Final essay and code due **Monday, Oct 22nd** by 11:59 PM

# Learning goals

* Create a music composition using a Processing sketch
* Assess your composition critically
* Reflect on the process of creating your composition
* Write about your composition, expressing the ways in which your composition succeeded, and the ways in which it could be improved

# Getting started

Start Processing.  You should see an empty Processing window.  Copy and paste the code from the following sketch:

> [Experiment.pde](https://github.com/ycpcs/fys100-fall2018/blob/gh-pages/assign/Experiment.pde)

Choose **File &rarr; Save As...**.  Make sure that your sketchbook folder (`H:/My Documents/Processing`) is selected as the folder.)  In the **Selection** text box, enter **MusicComposition**.  Click **OK**.

Congratulations!  You have created a Processing sketch called **MusicComposition**.

**Incredibly important and significant advice**: You should *mess around* with the code in the starting point sketch (`Experiment.pde`).  It is designed explicitly to demonstrate how basic rhythms, melodies, and figures are created, and how they can be arranged into a composition.  You should know that the specific values (beats, durations, note numbers, etc.) were chosen more or less arbitrarily.  You will find that, in general, trying random values will often create an interesting result.  So, you don't need to obsess too much about what you want the composition to sound like.  Just try some random things, *listen critically*, and see if it works!  If it doesn't work, change it!

# What to do

**Important**: Please create a folder called **Assignment 4** within your shared Google Drive folder (the one you created in [Writing Assignment 0](assign00.html)), and then create/upload your deliverables for this project in the **Assignment 4** folder.

# Tasks and deliverables

## Music composition Processing sketch

### Expectations

Write a Processing sketch to create a music composition.  Your composition should be a continuation of the work you did in [Lab 5](../labs/lab05.html), [Lab 6](../labs/lab06.html), and [Lab 7](../labs/lab07.html).

At a minimum, your composition should include percussion figures, melodic figures, and should have an overall structure.  We would encourage you to consider adding the following optional elements:

* Using a variety of soundfonts and instrument sounds
* Samples (see [Lab 7](../labs/lab07.html))

Please note that we do not want you to treat these features as a laundry list: we expect that for any element you incorporate into the composition, you have a specific artistic motivation for including it.

### What to create?

In creating your music composition, you should have an intention.  Here's a suggestion: imagine you are composing music for an introductory sequence for a video.  What characteristics should it have?  It should probably be:

* Fairly short: 15-30 seconds
* Catchy!
* Distinctive

Here is a composition that is, indeed, used in the intro sequence for a [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9zJKV-F2eMyKY6qdesRQP_mAhBCMSw2T) I am working on:

> [Intro.pde](https://github.com/ycpcs/fys100-fall2018/blob/gh-pages/assign/Intro.pde)

Note that although this composition is short (about 17 seconds), a significant amount of effort was invested in creating the rhythms and melodies, choosing soundfonts and instruments, and arranging the figures to create a sense of "purpose" in the composition.

### Submitting the sketch

Submit your sketch by uploading it to your shared Google Drive folder.  Your sketch is a file that has a ".pde" file extension.  You can upload a file to a Google Drive folder by clicking **New**, choosing **File upload**, and then selecting the file you want to upload.

<div class="callout">
<b>Important</b>: In addition to uploading the sketch code, please upload any samples that your composition uses.

## Reflective essay

Your essay should address the following topics.

*Introduction.*   What were you trying to achieve in creating your composition?  Did you have a specific inspiration?

*Describe your creative process.*  What did you do to create your composition?   How did your composition evolve over time?  What were your experiences using a computer program to create music?  What aspects of the process were satisfying?  What aspects of the process were frustrating?  If you encountered difficulties, what did you do to progress beyond them?

*Discuss the structure and organization of your composition.*  In particular, talk about the different "layers" of organization in your composition: individual rhythms and melodies, longer passages, the overall composition structure, etc.  What mood or emotions were you trying to evoke?

*In what ways did your composition succeed?*  In light of your intentions regarding the structure and organization of the composition, and the effects you were trying to convey, do you think you succeeded?

*In what ways do you think your composition could be improved?*  What aspects of the composition did not succeed in the way you had hoped?

*Conclusions.*  What did you learn from this experience?

Your reflection should be *at least* two pages in length.  (Two pages is a minimuim, and we would expect that it is more likely that three or more pages will be necessary.)  You should strive to be clear and concise.

Please read our [Effective Writing](../outcomes/writing.html) document for more information about our expectations for your writing.
