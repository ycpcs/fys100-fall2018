title: "Assignment 1: Journal"
---

This assignment is ongoing throughout the semester.

Each journal entry is due on 11:59 PM on Sunday, thoughout the semester, starting Sunday, September 2nd.

**Important**: For this assignment, late submissions won't (necessarily) be accepted.  In order for me to keep up with your journal entries, I need to be able to read them on Monday, so they need to be done by Sunday.

# Learning goals

* Use written language to describe your experience at York College and in this course
* Reflect on the work you are doing, what you are learning, and how you are meeting the academic challenges you face

# What to do

Each week, write at least 2 entries in the journal you created in [Assignment 0](assign00.html).  Make sure each entry is labeled with a date.  Each entry should consist of 1-2 paragraphs describing some combination of:

* What you are working on in this course (projects, assignments, etc.)
* Your experiences as a college student
* Challenges you have encountered, and how you have responded to them
* Anything else you think is interesting

Each entry should be both **concise** and **substantial**.

<div class="callout">Please make sure that all of your entries are in the same document, i.e., the one you created in <a href="assign00.html">Assignment 0</a>.</div>

# Grading

Each week, I will read your journal entries for the previous week, and mark your work as ✓ (satisfactorily completed) or ✗ (incomplete or unsatisfactory).  I may also add some comments and/or suggestions.
