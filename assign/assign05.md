# Learning goals

* Think critically about arguments made in sources such as articles and other works
* Construct an argument based on evidence
* Find sources of evidence
* Cite sources

# Can computers be creative?

This writing assignment is a continuation of the discussion of the MELOMICS project, as we discussed in the [Music discussion day](../agenda/day12.html).  You will investigate whether it is possible for computers to exhibit creativity, specifically in the area of music composition.

# Deliverables

Create a folder called `Assignment 5` in your shared Google drive folder.  All of your deliverables for this assignment should be placed in this folder.

## Annotated bibliography

This deliverable should be a document called `Annotated bibliography`.

You annotated bibliography is a list of sources you will use as evidence in making your argument.

We suggest that you start with the MELOMICS project sources (see the [Schedule](../schedule.html)).

In addition, you must find at least *one* information source beyond the MELOMICS sources.

Your annotated bibliography should list each source you will use, and briefly summarize the information in the source and assess the degree of credibility of the source.  (I.e., if you think it is possible that the source might be biased in some way, state this.)

## Outline

This deliverable should be a document called `Essay outline`.

The outline should indicate how your essay will be organized, and should briefly summarize what information you will provide in each section of the essay.  The outline should also give an overall sense of your argument and what evidence you will use to support it.

## Essay Draft

This deliverable should be a document called `Essay draft`.

The draft should substantially address the expectations of the final essay (see below.)

## Peer evaluations

You will be responsible for providing feedback on two other essay drafts.

The main goal of your feedback is to provide some specific ideas for what the essay does well and how it might be improved.  For example:

* What are the strengths of the essay?  Be sure to state at least one thing that you like about the essay.
* Does the essay have a clear thesis?
* Is the argument made to support the thesis convincing?
* Is evidence presented to support the thesis, and is it convincing?
* Are sources cited appropriately?
* Is the writing quality good?  Are there sentences or phrases that are confusing?

## Essay

The essay should be in a document called `Final essay`.

Your essay should argue for one of the following positions:

* Computers will never be able to compose music as well as human beings
* Computers cannot currently compose music as well as human beings, but someday they will
* Computers have reached the point where they can compose music as well as or better than human beings

Cite specific evidence supporting your position.  I would encourage you to use the reading/documentary/album from the music discussion day.  In addition, you are required to find *at least one additional source* to support your position.

Your essay must use [MLA format](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/01/) for sources.  Use citations as appropriate in your text when you refer to evidence in the sources you are using to support your argument.  Make sure that you have a list of works cited at the end of your essay.

Your essay should be *at least* three pages, not including the list of works cited.
