# Agenda

Today will be a large play day with Scratch4Arduino. We will walk throught a design process to help you take your ideas and make them into real prototypes. You will have 75 minutes to design a children's toy using the sensors, actuators, and materials from the Rube Goldberg kits.

## Get ready
