# Agenda

On day 6 we will experiment with *Generative Art*, which is a term used to describe art that is the result of a process or computation.

In particular, we will investigate *fractals*, which are visual patterns that exhibit self-similarity.  Fractals are often found in nature.

There are several readings.  As you do the readings, think about answers to the following reading questions:

* Is generative art actually art?
* If generative art is art, is the computer the artist, or the person who wrote the program that generated it?
* Do you think the computer-generated art in the Artnome article is truly comparable to the early 20th century modern art to which it is compared?

These are the readings:

* The first is textbook Chapters 4&ndash;5 of the textbook
* The second is [Chapter 8](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-8-fractals/) of [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/) (you can skim this, but it has some good examples of fractals and how to generate them)
* The third is an interview in [Artnome](https://www.artnome.com/): [Generative Art Finds Its Prodigy](https://www.artnome.com/news/2018/8/8/generative-art-finds-its-prodigy).

## Get ready

In your shared Google Drive folder, create a document called **GenerativeArt** and write your answers to the reading questions listed above.

Also, read through the description of [Lab 4](../labs/lab04.html).
