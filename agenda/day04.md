# Agenda

On day 4 we will continue to work on creating an image using Processing.

Specifically, we will use *procedural abstraction* to avoid repeated code when drawing similar or identical elements in the image.

## Get ready

<img class="parimg" alt="Get ready" src="img/getready.png"> 

First, continue working on the Processing program you started in [Lab 1](labs/lab01.html), so that you have a relatively complete rendering of your graph paper sketch.

Next, think about

* Whether there are elements in your image that are repeated exactly or with some kind of variation
* Whether you could add some kind of repeated element to your image

Annotate your graph paper sketch to indicate repeated elements.  Then, please read the write-up for [Lab 2](../labs/lab02.html), where we will explore ways of concisely expressing repetition in a Processing program.  Don't worry if you don't understand everything completely; we would just like you to have a sense of what you will be trying to accomplish in class.
