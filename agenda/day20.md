# Agenda
Download the [Lab 12 PDF](../labs/Lab12.pdf) from Github.

In the previous lab we have examined how to connect various sensors to the Arduino using Scratch. While Scratch enables us to make simple Arduino programs, it is limited to only communicate with the Arduino itself. To expand the range of possible Arduino interactions, we will access the Arduino directly from a Processing sketch. This will enable you to incorporate animation, sound, and other visual elements with physical input or output.
