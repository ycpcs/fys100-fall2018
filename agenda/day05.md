On day 5 we will experiment with animation.

## Get ready

<img class="parimg" alt="Get ready" src="img/getready.png">

To get ready, read the description for [Lab 3](../labs/lab03.html).  Also, if you do not yet have a function with x and/or y parameters that allows you to draw an element at an arbitrary position, please add one.  (See [Lab 2](../labs/lab02.html) for details.)

<div style="clear: both;"></div>
