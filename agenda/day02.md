# Agenda

Today's class meeting will be a continuation of the discussion from [Day 1](day01.html) about expectations for college.

We will also be discussing the two readings, [NYTEd30Jul15](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/education/edlife/advice-for-new-students-from-those-who-know-old-students.html) and [Lahey15](http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/08/when-success-leads-to-failure/400925/).

Finally, we will be talking about the expectations for the course.  Here are some of our thoughts:

* The course is about open-ended exploration, not "right" or "wrong" answers
* A major goal of the course is to engage in thoughtful criticism of ideas and creative works
* A major goal of the course is to think about the process you engage in as you work, and to reflect on ways in which you can improve
* The course should be a lot of fun

## Get ready

In your shared Google Drive folder, create a document called **CollegeExpectations**.

In this document, briefly write down answers to the following questions:

* In NYTEd30Jul15, what do you think are the two best recommendations? What do you think are the two worst recommendations?  Why?
* Lahey15 is written about middle school.  Do you think the issue the article discusses applies to college? Why or why not?

Make sure this document is ready *before* you come to class.
