# Agenda
Today we will be working with [Scratch4Arduino](http://s4a.cat). This is a block-based languaged original developed out of the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/). Yes, this is another programming language we're teaching you BUT if you can snap lego blocks together, you can program in Scratch.

Follow through on Lab 10 to get started. Also, begin reading [Weiser91](http://www.lri.fr/~mbl/Stanford/CS477/papers/Weiser-SciAm.pdf) and [Weiser93](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring99/cs598c/papers/p75-weiser.pdf) in preparation for our discussion on pervasive computing.
