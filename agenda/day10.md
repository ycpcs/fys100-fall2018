# Agenda

We will be working on [Lab 6](../labs/lab06.html), in which we experiment with melodies.

## Get ready

There are two things you should do.

First, create a document in your shared Google Drive folder called **MusicCompositionPlan**.  In it, write

* What style of music composition you are creating
* What kind of mood or feelings you would like to evoke
* What type of instrument sounds you plan to use
* What you think the structure of your composition will be (i.e., ABACAB), and what the parts will sound like

Second, read through the description of [Lab 6](../labs/lab06.html).
