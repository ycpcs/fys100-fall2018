# Agenda

We will work on [Lab 5](../labs/lab05.html) in class.  This is the beginning of the music unit of the course, and we will start by experimenting with rhythms and bass lines.

## Get ready

<img class="parimg" alt="Get ready" src="img/getready.png"> Do two things to get ready for class.  First, read the description for [Lab 5](../labs/lab05.html).  Second, find a pair of headphones or earbuds and bring them to class.  Note that they will need to have a standard 3.5mm analog audio plug &mdash; bluetooth headphones won't work.
