# Agenda

On day 11 we will work on [Lab 7](../labs/lab07.html).

## Get ready

Your task to get ready is to find some *samples*: short audio clips that you can play back as part of your composition.  One very good place to find samples is [freesound.org](http://www.freesound.org/).

Make sure that your samples have a sample rate of 44.1 KHz (which is 41,000 Hz).  Both mono and stereo samples are fine.

Create a folder called `Samples` on your `H:` drive and copy your samples into it.
