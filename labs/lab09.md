# Learning goals

* Learn about interfaces for analyzing and visualizing data sets
* Learn about Google's Ngram Viewer
* Form a hypothesis about words/phrases and see if you can test it using Google's Ngram tool

# What to do

Use the [Google Ngram viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams) to test a hypothesis about history or culture.

Create a report in a document called `NGramExperiment` in your shared Google drive folder.  It should have the following information:

1. Your hypothesis: a statement about history or culture that is either or true or false
2. A description of your experiment: what search terms can you give to the Google NGram viewer to test your hypothesis
3. Discussion of results: show the results plot produced by the NGram viewer, and discuss whether they support your hypothesis, and to what extent
4. Threats to validity: can you think of any reasons why the results might not be an accurate reflection of the phenomenon you are trying to measure?
