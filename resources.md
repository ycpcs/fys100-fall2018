This page has links to resources we will be using in the course.

[Processing](http://processing.org) &mdash; This is the programming language and environment we will be using for labs and projects.  I encourage you to download it and install it on your own computer.  *Important*: Make sure you get Processing 3 or later.  The current version is 3.2, which should work well.

[ProcessingLibs.zip](resources/ProcessingLibs.zip): This zipfile contains the three Processing libraries we will use in the course.  The computers in KEC 123 (our classroom) have these libraries pre-installed.  You can install them on your own computer by copying the folders in the zipfile (`controlP5`, `FunWithSound`, and `Terrapin`) into the `libraries` folder of your sketchbook folder on your computer.

[Audacity](http://audacityteam.org/) &mdash; A free, open-source audio recording and editing program.  This is handy for editing samples, finding parts of samples to play, saving audio clips in different formats, etc.
